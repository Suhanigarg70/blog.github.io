 Docker Server and Desktop Installation

First, install the docker server using the command line. Used many command line commands don't know exactly how but I did it.

Docker desktop installation

Set up Dockerâ€™s package repository. See step one of Install using the apt repository.
Download the latest DEB package.
Install the package with apt as follows:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<version>-<arch>.deb
 
 open a terminal and run: 
$ systemctl --user start docker-desktop
Now the docker desktop will be automatically be enabled once you start your system.
docker run -it <name of container>
if the container is present locally then it will run it or it will install it from hub.docker.com.

docker container ls- lists all the running containers
docker container ls -a -lists all the containers
docker start <container name> - stats a container
docker exec <container name> <command> 
ex docker exec ubuntu ls - list all the items in container ubuntu and return to home instead of the root of the container
docker exec -it <conatiner name> - now the terminal will not exit out of the container
-it stands for interactive tty
 docker run -it -p <port number>:<port number> <image name> - exposes the containers port to the devices port
example - docker run -it -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog

Docker file creation

craete a file with name Dockerfile 

now add your os, software version ,dependencies and commands int the file.

example of docker file:

FROM ubuntu

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y curl
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
RUN apt-get upgrade -y
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs

COPY package.json package.json
COPY package-lock.json package-lock.json
COPY main.js main.js

RUN npm install

ENTRYPOINT [ "node", "main.js" ]
command for building - docker build -t <image name> .
                                     . means to run the dockerfile in the current directory



command for running - docker run -it <image name>

Pushing our local image onto docker hub

log in to your account at hub.docker.com and create a new respository.
now push your local docker image into hub by the commad

docker push <image-name>

you need to be signed in your docker desktop to push.

to login use docker login 

Docker Compose

ypu may need to use more tha one conatiner that time you can create a dockerfile with more than one conatiner and list them under services

docker compose up

example:

version: "3.8"

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres # hub.docker.com
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: review
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password

  redis:
    image: redis
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
docker compose down

docker compose up -d
