 This is going to be my daily blog where i enter all the things I learned that day. I am a little late in starting this but better late then sorry.

So far I started with the project Flowise AI where I understood the application, cloned it on my device and added a component in it. For it I learned React.js.

I got to learn a lot about the system and technology via it.I could only add the font-end and was working on the back-end , learning node.js but was given a new project that's why had to leave it.

Now I have started with another project inn which I am working with  Qualcomm RB3 Gen2 Development kit.

It is a vision kit via which I have to do object detection.

I flashed the device as it had android and we wanted Linux. I installed the requires software than ran the Qualcomm's inbuilt object detection model

Now I have to create an docker container and run it on Kubernetes . The container will contain an object detection model.
