 Linux

So firstly i installed Ubuntu 22.04 desktop on my laptop and made it a dual boot.

Now i have windows and linux both in my system.

Terminal

I am learning how to use the terminal as it is quiet important. 

I am learning it from a course Satya sir gave me which is:

Course: The missing semester of your CS education

Topic 1: The Shell

 Shell commands:

date - tells the current date

ls - lists the items in that directory

       you can also add filters and options like

       ls -l for listing all the items with their full detail

       ls -r listing in reverse order

       ls -t listing according to time

       ls -ltr combining all these parameters

cd - change directory ex cd /opt 

        cd ~ sends to home directory

        cd / - sends to root directory

echo  - simply prints out its arguments

which - find out which file is executed for a given program

pwd - print working directory

cat - display content of the file

cp - copy

mv - move one file from one place to another or rename it

mv [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_file_name]
mv geeksforgeeks /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/ 
mkdir - make directory

man - manual

          ex mam man, ls man

> - take output

< - take input

echo hello > hello.txt
missing:~$ cat hello.txt
hello
missing:~$ cat < hello.txt
hello
missing:~$ cat < hello.txt > hello2.txt
missing:~$ cat hello2.txt
hello
>> - to append to a file

| - create a pipeline ex

s -l / | tail -n1
sudo su  - superuser, can make changes in root


tee - to both display and save output 

echo 3 | sudo tee brightness
vim - for writing scripts in linux
 exit in vim using :qm
Source - for sourcing that script in our terminal
= - you can assign value to any string
    for ex foo="hello"
    echo $foo it will print hello
"" - it will cosider the argument insdie it
'' - print the string inside it as it is without cosnidering any other command

foo=bar
echo "$foo"
# prints bar
echo '$foo'
# prints $foo
